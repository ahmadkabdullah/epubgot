# About
Utility to output EPUB into terminal as plaintext. Written in Golang, it does two things:
- List content: display how many chapters there are to read and how many images you'll miss.
- Output chapter: unzips EPUBs, selects an HTML file, converts it to text and prints to the terminal.

# Usage
$ epubgot # program info
$ epubgot programmingingo.epub # list content
$ epubgot programmingingo.epub 12 # output chapter

# Build
Use this one-liner (Must have Golang and Git installed, obviously):
    $ git clone https://codeberg.org/ahmadhf/epubgot; cd epubgot; go build -o epubgot-build
